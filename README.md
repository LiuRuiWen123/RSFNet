The code was developed in VSCode and the config file can be directly loaded to replicate the results.
Change dataset paths etc. appropriately.

For a purely optimization based factorization (without learning), directly run LLE.py
LLE.py was initially developed using quaternion library (which was found later to be not necessary and simple vector optimization is sufficient). 

TODO: Add full details and run scripts.
